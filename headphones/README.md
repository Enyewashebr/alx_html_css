This repository contains a project focused on creating a responsive web page for a headphones manufacturer, following a design specification provided by a UI/UX designer. The goal is to build a fully functional web page using only HTML and CSS, without external frameworks or JavaScript.

The key requirements for this project include:

1. Responsive design: The web page must adapt to mobile screens with a width of 480px or less.
2. Font usage: The project uses the Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT fonts, which are provided if not installed.
3. Styling: The project utilizes variables and generic CSS selectors, avoiding overly specific selectors.

The project is divided into several tasks, each implemented in a separate set of HTML and CSS files:

1. Header/Hero Piece
2. "What we do..." Section
3. "Our results" Section
4. Contact Us Section
5. Footer
6. Background Image Replacement
7. Animation Implementation

The repository structure follows this task-based organization, with each task having its own HTML and CSS files. The project showcases proficiency in front-end web development, focusing on the implementation of a complex design using clean HTML/CSS code and responsive design practices.
